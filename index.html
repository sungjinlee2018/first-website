<br> li lists the lists.<br>
<br> ol is oldered list, and ul is unordered list. <br>
<br>ol or ul should come along with li. this is parent and child relationship. <br>

<br><strong> Strong </strong> makes words bold,
and <u> u </u> underlines the word.<br>

<h1> This is the biggest word. </h1>
<h2> This is the second biggest one. </h2>
<h3> This is the third biggest one.  </h3>
<h4> This is the forth biggest one. </h4>
<h5> This is the fifth biggest one. </h5>
<h6> This is the smallest one. </h6>

br changes the line. <br><br> br changes the line, and we don't have put / at the end.

<p style="margin-top:45px;"> p works same as br, but we can apply CSS into it.</p>
<p> the reason why p is more flexible.</p>
<p> html shows the information, and CSS decorates the information. </p>

we can make the title either through h3 or normal and make it bigger and bold,
but it has an obvious difference. It's very important to learn how to use proper
methods for proper purpose.
